Hey there! I'm Benson—a passionate learner currently diving into the MERN stack and Python to build full-stack web applications. I love exploring how backend logic and smart analytics can bring projects to life. Whether it’s crafting clean UI or coding powerful backend features, I’m here to build with purpose.

Right now, I’m focused on:

📚 Learning MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js

🐍 Experimenting with Python to level up backend functionality

🚀 Building real-world projects that showcase creativity and growth

I'm on a mission to complete standout projects, craft a compelling portfolio, and land a dev role where I can grow, contribute, and keep learning.
